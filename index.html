                        <p>üíê I started crocheting in December 2021. I still remember how small my hook was. With that, I never really finished a decent piece; the tops I made are always super tight. Yes, tops - the first one I planned to crochet because my sister wouldn't let me borrow hers. So basically, it was one of the reasons why I am so into crochet right now.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>üíê The first yarn that I used was acrylic; I bought it for 13 pesos at an arts and craft store called MUE. It wasn't the best yarn, but I finished a super tight top tube - so tight that I could not breathe. After that, I stopped crocheting for a fleeting time because I lacked tools and was hesitant to buy them online.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>üíê I continued in May 2022 because I was planning to make a little bouquet of crocheted flowers for my boyfriend's birthday. My mom bought me my first milk cotton yarns online, and I made a carnation flower, lavender, and forget-me-not.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>üíê It was just a small bouquet, but it meant everything to my bf because he hadn't received any of those in his entire life. Then I thought about the world. So many sad and depressed people. The sadness doesn't go away in a snap; I know that because I experienced it - we all do. Crochet became my coping mechanism, and every time I finish a flower, it makes me happy because I was able to craft a beautiful piece out of yarn and patience. Little things, right? But those we label "little" have the biggest impact on our lives. I managed to keep my shit together by focusing on these little things.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>üíê Then I thought to myself, what can I contribute to the world I live in? I am still a first-year student studying BS Psychology - what could I offer? I've always known that I want to know more about people because, like the universe, people are complex. But despite the complexity, little things never fail to melt us. With my crocheted flowers, I want to uplift one's feelings. I want to be a part of the reason why they feel special.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>üíê I never felt tired crafting those crocheted pieces because I enjoy what I'm doing. And I also love the fact that people who received my works feel special and loved. I guess that's the least thing I could do for now in contributing to the world I live in. Because in the end, it's always the little things.</p>
